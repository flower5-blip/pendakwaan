# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: "INTENTIONAL MINIMALISM"

## CORE PRINCIPLES
*   **Anti-Generic:** Reject standard "bootstrapped" layouts. If it looks like a template, it is wrong.
*   **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
*   **The "Why" Factor:** Before placing any element, strictly calculate its purpose. If it has no purpose, delete it.
*   **Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication.

## KEY VISUALS
*   Focus on micro-interactions.
*   Perfect spacing (whitespace is an active element).
*   "Invisible" UX where the design guides the user without friction.
